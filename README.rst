Introduction
------------

This is an MIT licensed flake8 plugin for enforcing a Python string formatting
preference. It is available to install from the `Python Package Index (PyPI)
<https://pypi.org/project/flake8-sfs/>`_.

For historical reasons, the Python programming language has accumulated
multiple ways to do string formatting. The three main ones are:

* Percent operator (violation codes ``SFS1##``), as in this example:

.. code :: pycon

    >>> name = "Peter"
    >>> price = 1.2
    >>> print("Hello %s, do you have $%0.2f?" % (name, price))
    Hello Peter, do you have $1.20?

* Format method (violation codes ``SFS2##``), available since Python 2.6,

.. code :: pycon

    >>> name = "Peter"
    >>> price = 1.2
    >>> print("Hello {}, do you have ${:0.2f}?".format(name, price))
    Hello Peter, do you have $1.20?

* f-strings (violation codes ``SFS3##``), available since Python 3.6,

.. code :: pycon

    >>> name = "Peter"
    >>> price = 1.2
    >>> print(f"Hello {name}, do you have ${price:0.2f}?")

We are spoilt for choice, but quoting the `Zen of Python
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_, *There should be one - and
preferably only one - obvious way to do it*. This flake8 plugin exists to let
you define which of these styles your project allows.

By default this plugin complains about all three styles - we expect you to make
an explicit choice and configure which codes to ignore. See uses cases below.

Flake8 Validation codes
-----------------------

Early versions of flake8 assumed a single character prefix for the validation
codes, which became problematic with collisions in the plugin ecosystem. Since
v3.0, flake8 has supported longer prefixes therefore this plugin uses ``SFS``
as its prefix (short for String Format Style).

Prefix ``SFS1`` - percent operator:

====== =======================================================================
Code   Description
------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------
SFS101 String literal formatting using percent operator.
SFS102 Bytes literal formatting using percent operator.
====== =======================================================================

Prefix ``SFS2`` - format method:

====== =======================================================================
Code   Description
------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------
SFS201 String literal formatting using .format method.
SFS202 String formatting with str.format('...', ...) directly.
====== =======================================================================

Prefix ``SFS3`` - f-strings:

====== =======================================================================
Code   Description
------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------
SFS301 String literal formatting using f-string.
====== =======================================================================

You can use a partial code like ``SFS1`` in flake8 to ignore all the ``SFS1##``
percent formatting codes.

Use cases
=========

If you accept that f-strings are best, you could run a tool like `flynt
<https://github.com/ikamensh/flynt>`__ or `pyupgrade
<https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade>`__ to automatically convert your code,
and then use this flake8 plugin to enforce the style by configuring it to
ignore the ``SFS301`` violation.

You might be maintaining a project which still supports Python 2, where you
have a mix of percent and format method string formatting. Here tell flake8 to
ignore the ``SFS1`` and ``SFS2`` prefixes, and complain only about f-strings
which would be a syntax error on Python 2 (i.e. enforce only prefix ``SFS3``).

Alternatively, you might have a large legacy codebase with lots of the percent
formatting - yet want to move any format methods to f-strings. Here you could
ignore the ``SFS1`` and ``SFS3`` prefixes and enforce only the format method
checks (``SFS2`` prefix).

Or you might say the old ways are the best, and configure flake8 to ignore the
percent formatting but treat either the format method or f-strings as errors
(by ignoring the ``SFS1`` prefix).

Installation and usage
----------------------

Python 3.9 or later is required.

We recommend installing the plugin using pip, which handles the dependencies::

    $ pip install flake8-sfs

Alternatively, if you are using the Anaconda packaging system, the following
command will install the plugin with its dependencies::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge flake8-sfs

The new validator should be automatically included when using ``flake8`` which
may now report additional validation codes starting with ``SFS`` (as defined
above). For example::

    $ flake8 example.py

You can request only the ``SFS`` codes be shown using::

    $ flake8 --select SFS example.py

You should add at least some SFS validation codes to your flake8 configuration
file's select or ignore list.

Configuration
-------------

We assume you are familiar with `flake8 configuration
<http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html>`_.

Unless your code performs no string formatting at all (which would be unusual),
you should tell flake8 to ignore at least one of this plugin's violation codes.
For example::

    [flake8]
    extend-ignore =
        # Ignore f-strings, we like them:
        SFS301,

Note that flake8 allows splitting comma separated lists over multiple lines,
and allows including of hash comment lines.

Developers
----------

This plugin is on GitHub at https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-sfs

Developers may install the plugin from the git repository with optional build
dependencies::

    $ pip install -e .[develop]

To make a new release once tested locally and online::

    $ git tag vX.Y.Z
    $ python -m build
    $ git push origin master --tags
    $ twine upload dist/flake8?sfs-X.Y.Z*

The PyPI upload should trigger an automated pull request updating the
`flake8-sfs conda-forge recipe
<https://github.com/conda-forge/flake8-sfs-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/meta.yaml>`_.
